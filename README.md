### How to play
The goal for the player is to cross the road and to move to the blue sea. While doing this, the player must avoid collision with the enemies,
otherwise he has to begin at the start again. The game end when the player reaches the blue sea.

### Todos

 - Add initial screen, where player can choose layouts (e.g. layout of map, image of player, image of enemies)
 - Add gems to the game which the player can collect (e.g. "freeze all enemies" gem)
